Adam and Rachel met on the first day of their pre-orientation program at Tufts University. They were best friends all the way through college, and after graduation, they planned a road trip across the country together. Starting in California, they drove Rachel's Mini Cooper across the southern United States and along the eastern seabord until they reached Massachusetts. After 3 weeks of 24/7 hiking, driving, camping, and site seeing, the two remained inseparable. In spite of repeatedly being asked whether they were dating, they continued to say they were "just friends" until finally one of them (**cough** Rachel **cough**) got up the nerve to tell the other how she was feeling. 
<br/><br/>
Four years later and four days after Adam's 27th birthday, the two were dining at their favorite restaurant, when Adam got down on one knee in front of the entire restaurant and proposed. Rachel forgot to say yes, but he took the vigorous nodding as a good sign she was on board.
