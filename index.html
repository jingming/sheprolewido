Adam and Rachel met the very first hour of the very first day of their pre-orientation program at Tufts University. We'd love to say it was love at first sight, but they were both in serious long term relationships with other people. Throughout college, they were best friends who studied together, vacationed together, and engaged in way too many Facebook pokes.

After graduation, they planned a road trip across the country together. After 3 weeks of 24/7 hiking, driving, camping, and site seeing, the two remained inseparable. Finally one of them (**cough** Rachel **cough**) got up the nerve to tell the other how she was feeling. Their first date was simultaneously incredibly awkward and incredibly comfortable, and thankfully, they found their groove.

Four years after that first date, the two were dining at their favorite restaurant, celebrating Adam's 27th birthday. After dessert, Adam got down on one knee in front of the entire restaurant and proposed. Rachel forgot to say yes, but he took the vigorous nodding as a good sign she was on board.

The easiest way to get to the hotel is via the MBTA. Charlie tickets can be purchased at any station. Parking will be availabe at the hotel for a fee of $25 for the event and $52 over night.

The Liberty Hotel has reserved a block of rooms for us under the name "Lew Shepro Wedding" starting at $299 per night. For alternate accommodation, be sure to check out several of the other hotels nearby such as the Marriott in Kendall Square or the Wyndham just down the street. Boston also has an excellent selection of Airbnb's if you would rather stay with more of the comforts of home.
